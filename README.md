## Current Position
### Postdoctoral Researcher (2021-present)
**Lab of Prof. Julijana Gjorgjieva, School of Life Science, Technical University of Munich (TUM), Germany**
- Study of inhibitory spike-timing dependent plasticity rules ensuring excitatory/inhibitory balance and specific connectivity structures in recurrent circuits.
- Mentoring students in internships on plasticity and neural dynamics.
- Teaching Assistant for the Computational Neuroscience course, Master of Science in Neuroengineering, TUM.

## Research Experience
### Postdoctoral Researcher (2016-2021)
**Lab of Dr. Ruben Coen-Cagli, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA**
- Developed a probabilistic inference model tuned to natural image statistics, predicting mean response and trial-to-trial response variability of neurons in primary visual cortex (V1).
- Reimplemented and extended the model for analytical studies and numerical simulations.
- Collaborated with Prof. Adam Kohn’s lab for theory testing using existing data and new experiments.
- Contributed to stimulus design and data analysis (including spike-sorting).

### Ph.D. Studies (2012-2016)
**Group of Prof. Máté Lengyel, Computational and Biological Learning Lab (CBL), Cambridge, UK**
- Developed a novel optimization procedure for stabilized supralinear networks (SSNs) with multiple fixed-point attractors.
- Modeled and tested systems extensively, comparing them with state-of-the-art approaches.

### Research Intern (2011-2012)
**Lab of Prof. Fred Wolf, MPI for Complex Dynamics and Self Organization, Göttingen, Germany**
- Implemented computation of “Lyapunov vectors” in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to characterize the ergodic properties of RNNs.
